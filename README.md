# Inventory Weight 

## Project Summary

This project is a Minecraft plugin for the [Spigot API](https://www.spigotmc.org/) written in Java. The plugin is great for hardcore and role-play servers. It makes Minecraft more realistic by giving server owners the ability to assign weights to items. The heavier you are the slower you will move until you reach the max inventory capacity. Check out the plugin on the [Spigot resource page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/inventory-weight-1-12-0-1-15.70929/) to learn more and download the plugin.
